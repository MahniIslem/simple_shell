In this project we were assigned to re-impliment the Bourn Again Shell (BASH)

This shell should:
Display diplay a prompt and wait for user to type a command. A command line always end with a newline.
The command lines are simple no semicolons no pipes no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are only made of one lines. No urguments will be passed to the programs.
If an exutable can not be found it will print an arror message and display the prompt again.
Handle arrors.
It will aslo handle "End of file" condition (cntrl+D)
This Shell does not:
Use the PATH.
Impliment build-ins.
Handle special charactors: ", ', `, \, *, &, #.
